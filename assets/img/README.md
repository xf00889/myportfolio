# Image Assets

## Profile Picture (profile.jpg)

**Requirements:**
- Dimensions: 270x270 pixels
- File size: ~100KB or less
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Content: Professional headshot photo

**Current Status:**
The current `profile.jpg` is a placeholder. Replace it with an actual professional photo that meets the above requirements.

**Alternative:**
A placeholder SVG (`profile.svg`) has been provided with initials "JV". You can use this temporarily by updating the image reference in `index.html` from `profile.jpg` to `profile.svg`.

## Optimization Tips

To optimize images for web:
1. Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
2. Resize to exact dimensions needed (270x270px for profile)
3. Use appropriate compression (80-85% quality for JPG)
4. Consider WebP format for better compression
